Break down the epic into manageable features.
- Define the Epic and its Goal: Start by clearly defining the epic, its overarching purpose, and the business value it aims to deliver, aligning it with strategic initiatives or high-priority goals.
- Identify User Personas and Pain Points: Understand who the epic is for and their specific needs or pain points that the epic will address.
- Brainstorm and Outline Potential Features: Based on the epic's goal and user needs, brainstorm the various features that will contribute to achieving the epic. Each feature should provide tangible business value and be a distinct, deliverable increment.
- Define Acceptance Criteria for Each Feature: For each identified feature, establish clear and measurable acceptance criteria. These define what "done" looks like for that feature and ensure it meets the user's needs and the epic's objectives.

- Use the following template for each feature:
  - **Title**: [Story Title]
  - **Description**: [Brief description of the feature]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [Criterion 1]
    - [Criterion 2]
    - [Criterion 3]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Estimation**: [Story points or time estimate]
- Save each features into separate readme file, follow this naming convention `feature-[feature-title].md` and persist everything into 'docs/backlog/' directory.

- Refine and Review: Continuously

- Consider Dependencies and Risks: Identify any dependencies between features or with other teams, and assess potential risks that could impact the delivery of the epic.

- Track the status of the feature in the readme file by adding a status section at the end of each feature file:
  - **Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed/Blocked]
