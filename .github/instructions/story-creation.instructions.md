Break down the features into smaller, manageable stories.
- Each story should be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST).
- Ensure each story has a clear acceptance criteria.
- Use the following template for each story:
  - **Title**: [Story Title]
  - **Description**: [Brief description of the story]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [Criterion 1]
    - [Criterion 2]
    - [Criterion 3]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Estimation**: [Story points or time estimate]
  - **Order**: [Execution order if applicable]
- Save each stories into separate readme file, follow this naming convention `story-[story-title].md` and persist everything into 'docs/backlog/' directory.

- Add the NFR stories as well including Authentication, Authorization, Security, Usability, Performance, Maintanability, Scalability, and Reliability.

- Refine and Review

- Track the status of the userstory in the readme file by adding a status section at the end of each feature file:
  - **Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed/Blocked]
